# Distributed Acoustic Sensing Self Supervised Denoising - PyTorch

Based on J-invariance denoising (Noise2Self)  
and original paper by Martijn van den Ende et. al. : 

*A Self-Supervised Deep Learning Approach for
Blind Denoising  
and Waveform Coherence
Enhancement in Distributed Acoustic Sensing data*.
     
This is my implementation, written in PyTorch (still in progress),  
for my MSc Thesis on the Data Science & Machine Learning Master Course.
